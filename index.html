            Grid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, meaning they apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices, but not the first xs breakpoint).
            You can use predefined grid classes (like .col-4) or Sass mixins for more semantic markup.
